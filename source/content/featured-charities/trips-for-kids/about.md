Operating in the United States, Canada, Israel and Sierra Leone, Trips for Kids® (TFK®) has opened the world of cycling to over 140,500 at-risk youth since 1988 through mountain bike rides and Earn-A-Bike programs. The over 85 Trips for Kids chapters we support combine lessons in confidence building, achievement and environmental awareness through the development of practical skills, and the simple act of having fun.
