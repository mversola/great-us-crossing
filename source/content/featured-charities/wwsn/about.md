This spring, join the country's most passionate and dedicated cyclists in an epic challenge to (virtually) ride across the country, collectively covering thousands of miles in teams of up to five members to raise funds and awareness for The Wounded Warrior Support Network.

The Wounded Warrior Support Network believes that the best help to our Wounded Warriors comes from other Wounded Warriors. The Wounded Warrior Support Network provides Wounded Warriors, both active duty and veteran wounded, ill and injured nationwide with a team of Wounded Warriors who stay connected through the long journey back to happy and productive lives. The Wounded Warriors and their families enjoy sporting events, homemade meals, concerts, family reunions, and career guidance, and individualized customized support. We provide happiness and hope.

Join us. Wherever you live, wherever you ride, whatever your pace, or fitness level - see how far you can #CrossWithUs.
