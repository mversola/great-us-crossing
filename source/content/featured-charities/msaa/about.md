This spring, join the country's most passionate and dedicated cyclists in an epic challenge to (virtually) ride across the country, collectively covering thousands of miles in teams of up to five members to raise funds and awareness for The Multiple Sclerosis Association of America (MSAA).

The Multiple Sclerosis Association of America (MSAA) is a leading resource for the entire MS community, improving lives today through vital services and support to individuals with MS, their families, and their care partners.

Founded in 1970, this national nonprofit organization provides free services throughout the U.S. for everyone affected by MS. Programs include a Helpline, educational videos and publications, safety and mobility equipment distribution, cooling accessories, educational events, and more.

MSAA also offers Shared Management tools – such as our award-winning mobile app, My MS ManagerTM – to help patients and healthcare providers work together on education, training, and use of technology to manage the ever-changing course of multiple sclerosis and achieve the best possible health outcomes.

Join us. Wherever you live, wherever you ride, whatever your pace, or fitness level - see how far you can #CrossWithUs.
